## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student specializing in **Humanoid Robotics** and **Motor Control**, dedicated to applying advanced control theory to robotic systems. My research interests include model-based and learning-based locomotion control for humanoid robots, parameter identification, state estimation, and motor drives. I aspire to contribute to the advancement of robotics technology.

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the School of Engineering Science / Institute of Humanoid Robotics, <a href="https://www.ustc.edu.cn/en/">University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a>, supervised by Prof. Shiwu Zhang and Dr. Wei Gao. I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from the School of Automation, <a href="http://en.hfut.edu.cn/">Hefei University of Technology (HFUT)</a>.

I have published several academic papers (including co-authored works), which are listed below. <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_lZNOiUAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=Citations"></a>
